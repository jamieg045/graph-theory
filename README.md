# Graph Theory Project G00377566

This is my repository for my Graph Theory project Jupitor Notebook on the Graph Isomprhism Problem for Year 3 Software Development at the Atlantic Technological University Galway (ATU).

This repository contains all the workings and information I have researched and collected as part of my project. As part of this project I am required to create one Jupityr notebook on the topic of the Graph Isomoprhism problem which I have included as part of my repository above.

## Contents
As of now the project contains just this README.md file and the graph_isomoprhism.ipynb file which contains my Jupityr notebook.

## Prerequisites

In order to successfully run this project from another desktop, you must have Python, Jupityr notebook and Git installed on your machine. This is vital as the project will not run on your machine without any of these three components.

Step 1: Installation
* Install Jupityr https://jupyter.org/
* Install Python https://www.python.org/
* Install Git https://git-scm.com/download/win

Step 2: Download the Project onto your machine
* Go to the project page on GitHub and select 'Code'.
* You will get a dropdown menu with several options, click Download Zip. This will download a copy of the repository onto your physical machine.
* Extract the zip copy of the repository with all files and folders.
* Enter the command prompt in the destination of the project folder by clicking the top of the folder where 'graph-theory-main' is written. This will bring up a command prompt window in the path of the project.
* Entr 'jupityr notebook' into the command prompt.

## The Notebook
When the command is executed, the jupityr notebook should run providing you have all the prerequisites installed. You can navigate into the 'graph_isomorphism.ipynb' as a result. When you enter the notebook, all the material should be displayed and functioning as required.

If these steps prove successful, you will be able to read my Graph Theory Jupityr notebook project. Enjoy!

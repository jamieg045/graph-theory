    "<p> The Graph Isomorphism problem is a fundamental problem in computer science that deals with determining whether two given graphs are isomorphic, meaning that they have the same structure but may have different node or edge labels. More formally, given two graphs G and H, the Graph Isomorphism problem asks whether there exists a bijective function f from the set of nodes of G to the set of nodes of H such that for any two nodes u and v in G, u and v are adjacent in G if and only if f(u) and f(v) are adjacent in H.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Graph Isomorphism problem has been studied extensively in theoretical computer science and is known to be in the complexity class NP (nondeterministic polynomial time). However, it is not known whether it is in P (polynomial time) or NP-complete (meaning that it is at least as hard as any other problem in NP).\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite its theoretical importance, the Graph Isomorphism problem does not arise frequently in practical applications. Nonetheless, it has connections to other areas of computer science, such as cryptography and computational biology, and has also been used as a benchmark problem for the development of algorithms for graph matching and subgraph isomorphism. </p>"
